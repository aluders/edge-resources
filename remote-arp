created the following script on a wave pico to find access point ip addresses on a network so I could ssh to them and set-inform from uisp terminal...

#!/bin/sh

# Change this to match your subnet's network address
SUBNET="192.168.1."

# Loop through all possible addresses from 1 to 254
for i in $(seq 1 254); do
    # Use -c 1 to send only one ping packet
    ping -c 1 -W 1 "$SUBNET$i" > /dev/null 2>&1 &
done

# Wait a moment for pings to complete
sleep 5

# Check the ARP table to see which IPs responded
arp -n | grep "$SUBNET"

nvidia shield tv pro setup...

the following is for usb connecting the shield to a windows computer however I did the network adb steps using my mac after installing platform tools via homebrew...
brew install android-platform-tools
device preferences > about ... click build until developer options are enabled
device preferences > developer options ... enable usb debugging and network debugging
plug keyboard into close-to-hdmi usb and computer into far-from-hdmi usb
network adb from computer (approve connection on screen)
adb connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
adb reboot bootloader
unlock bootloader using keyboard and on-screen option
reboot using on-screen option
redo all steps necessary to get back to bootloader menu
manually install Android Bootloader Interface driver on usb connected computer

get android platform tools and place shield image files in platform tools directory (for this whole project I was looking for version 8.2.3 - if no longer on nvidia site, it's on qnap)
https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip
https://developer.nvidia.com/gameworksdownload
run the following via command prompt in the platform tools path...
fastboot devices (should return device id to confirm connection)
fastboot flash staging blob
fastboot flash boot boot.img
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
fastboot flash system system.img
fastboot flash vendor vendor.img
fastboot flash dtb mdarcy.dtb.img
fastboot flash vbmeta vbmeta.img
fastboot oem lock (approve on-screen)
fastboot reboot
now you need to re-enable the developer options and network adb again to run the following after installing FLauncher...
adb connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.tvlauncher
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.tvrecommendations
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.leanbacklauncher
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.leanbacklauncher.recommendations
now install button mapper for setting the netflix button under add button
set the menu button preferences for mute under the shield built-in accessories menu

some of this taken from...
https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/gameworks/downloads/regular/howtoflash/How-To-Flash-Recovery-Image.txt

to get custom wallpapers to work in FLauncher...
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.android.documentsui
adb shell pm enable com.android.documentsui (if it needs to be reversed)
